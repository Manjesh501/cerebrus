# Cerberus AI Cybershield - Enhanced Features Implementation

## üöÄ New Advanced Features Added

This document outlines the major enhancements made to the Cerberus AI Cybershield project to transform it into a comprehensive, enterprise-ready malware analysis platform.

## üìã Summary of Enhancements

### 1. üê≥ Advanced Docker Sandboxing (`advanced_sandbox.py`)
- **Isolated Execution Environment**: Secure Docker containers for malware analysis
- **Network Traffic Monitoring**: Real-time capture and analysis of network activity
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU, memory, and system resource tracking
- **Multi-platform Support**: Windows and Linux container analysis
- **Memory Forensics**: Integration with Volatility framework for memory dump analysis
- **Automated Cleanup**: Safe environment teardown after analysis

**Key Features:**
```python
# Docker-based sandbox with network isolation
with DockerSandbox(timeout=120) as sandbox:
    results = sandbox.analyze_file(file_path, analysis_type="comprehensive")
```

### 2. üõ°Ô∏è Anti-Evasion Detection System (`anti_evasion.py`)
- **VM Detection Countermeasures**: Fake VM artifacts to fool anti-VM techniques
- **Anti-Debug Detection**: Identification and neutralization of debugging evasion
- **Time-based Evasion**: Detection of sleep calls and timestamp manipulation
- **Code Unpacking**: Automatic unpacking for UPX and other packers
- **Behavioral Hooking**: API call interception and monitoring
- **Entropy Analysis**: Detection of packed/encrypted code

**Key Capabilities:**
```python
# Comprehensive evasion technique detection
detector = AntiEvasionDetector()
evasion_results = detector.detect_evasion_techniques(file_path)
```

### 3. üåê Multi-Source Threat Intelligence (`threat_intelligence.py`)
- **VirusTotal Integration**: Enhanced API integration with caching
- **YARA Rule Engine**: Custom rule compilation and scanning
- **IOC Database**: Indicators of Compromise management
- **Threat Attribution**: Automated threat actor attribution
- **Multi-API Support**: Hybri
