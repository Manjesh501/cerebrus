Test file with suspicious name pattern: invoice_payment.exe.txt

This is a test file to simulate an attachment that would trigger Cerberus warnings.

When renamed to have suspicious extensions like:
- invoice.exe
- payment.scr  
- document.bat
- urgent_update.pif

The Cerberus system would flag these as high-risk based on:
1. Suspicious filename patterns
2. Dangerous file extensions
3. Social engineering indicators

This helps protect users from malware disguised as legitimate documents.
