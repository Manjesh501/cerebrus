# Cerberus Chrome Extension - Connection Fixes

This document explains the fixes implemented to resolve the "Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist" error in the Cerberus Chrome extension.

## Problem Analysis

The error "Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist" occurs when:
1. The content script is not loaded or registered properly
2. The content script is not ready to receive messages
3. The tab ID is incorrect or the tab no longer exists
4. Permissions are missing for messaging or script injection

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in Popup
- Added fallback mechanism to send messages through the background script when direct content script messaging fails
- Improved error messages to provide more context about what went wrong
- Added better logging for debugging purposes

### 2. Robust Background Script Messaging
- Added tab query fallback using promises for better error handling
- Implemented content script injection when messaging fails
- Added retry mechanism after injection
- Enhanced error logging with detailed information

### 3. Improved Content Script Initialization
- Added ping/pong mechanism to verify content script is active
- Implemented ready signal to background script
- Enhanced message listener to handle all message types properly
- Added better logging for debugging

### 4. Added Required Permissions
- Added "scripting" permission to manifest for content script injection
- Verified all required permissions are present

### 5. Comprehensive Testing Tools
- Created connection test HTML page for verifying fixes
- Added ping/pong messaging for connection verification
- Implemented detailed debug information gathering

## How the Fix Works

1. **Popup sends rescan message** to content script via `chrome.tabs.sendMessage()`
2. **If messaging fails** due to "receiving end does not exist":
   - Popup sends message to background script as fallback
   - Background script attempts to inject content script
   - Background script retries the message after injection
3. **Content script sends ready signal** when loaded
4. **Ping/pong mechanism** allows verification of connection status

## Testing the Fix

1. Load the extension in Chrome developer mode
2. Open Gmail in a new tab
3. Click the Cerberus extension icon
4. Click "Rescan Attachments" - it should now work
5. For detailed testing, open the connection test page:
   `chrome-extension://[extension-id]/connection_test.html`

## Verification Steps

1. Open Chrome Developer Tools (F12) for the extension
2. Check console for "Cerberus Gmail scanner initialized" message
3. Verify "Message listener set up for Gmail content script" appears
4. Click "Rescan Attachments" and verify no connection errors
5. Check that attachments are properly detected and scanned
