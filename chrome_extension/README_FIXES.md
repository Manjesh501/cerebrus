# Cerberus Chrome Extension - Gmail Integration Fixes

This document outlines the fixes made to resolve issues with the Cerberus Chrome extension not working properly with Gmail.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Rescan Attachments Button Not Working
**Problem**: The "Rescan Attachments" button in the popup was not properly communicating with the Gmail content script.

**Fixes Made**:
- Enhanced error handling in [popup.js](popup.js) to properly catch and display messaging errors
- Improved message forwarding in [background.js](background.js) to correctly route rescan requests to the active Gmail tab
- Fixed message listener in [gmail-content.js](gmail-content.js) to properly respond to rescan requests

### 2. Gmail Attachment Detection Issues
**Problem**: The extension was not properly detecting Gmail attachments due to outdated CSS selectors.

**Fixes Made**:
- Added modern Gmail CSS selectors to [gmail-content.js](gmail-content.js)
- Improved attachment extraction logic to handle various Gmail UI elements
- Enhanced initialization logic to better detect when Gmail is fully loaded

### 3. Messaging Between Components
**Problem**: Communication between popup, content script, and background script was unreliable.

**Fixes Made**:
- Added proper error handling for Chrome runtime messaging
- Implemented better message channel management
- Added debugging logs to track message flow

## Files Modified

### [popup.js](popup.js)
- Enhanced `rescanAttachments()` function with better error handling
- Improved notification system with better error reporting
- Added safety checks for DOM element access

### [gmail-content.js](gmail-content.js)
- Added modern Gmail CSS selectors for attachment detection
- Improved message listener to properly handle different message types
- Enhanced initialization logic to work with Gmail's dynamic loading
- Fixed attachment extraction to handle various Gmail UI elements

### [background.js](background.js)
- Improved message routing for rescan requests
- Added better error handling and logging
- Enhanced message forwarding to active Gmail tabs

### [manifest.json](manifest.json)
- Added test files to web accessible resources

## New Test Files

### [test_gmail_functionality.html](test_gmail_functionality.html)
A comprehensive test page to verify Gmail integration functionality.

### [test_script.js](test_script.js)
A JavaScript test script for manual testing of extension components.

## Testing Instructions

1. Load the extension in Chrome developer mode
2. Open Gmail in a new tab
3. Click on the Cerberus extension icon
4. Verify that the Gmail protection status shows as active
5. Click the "Rescan Attachments" button
6. Check the console for debugging messages
7. Open the test page at `chrome-extension://[extension-id]/test_gmail_functionality.html` for comprehensive testing

## Debugging Tips

- Check the background script console for error messages
- Check the content script console when on Gmail pages
- Use the test page to verify component communication
- Look for "Cerberus" prefixed console messages for debugging information

## Known Limitations

- Gmail's dynamic loading may still cause occasional detection delays
- Some attachment types may not be detected if they don't match the CSS selectors
- The extension requires Gmail to be fully loaded before detection works properly

## Future Improvements

- Implement more robust Gmail UI detection
- Add support for additional attachment types
- Improve performance with more efficient DOM scanning
- Add more comprehensive error recovery mechanisms
