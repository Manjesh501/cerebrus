# Cerberus Chrome Extension - Issue Fixes

This document explains the fixes implemented to resolve the issues identified in the Cerberus Chrome extension.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Multiple Indicators on Same Attachment
**Problem**: Attachments were showing multiple "THREAT DETECTED" and "SAFE" indicators stacked on top of each other.

**Root Cause**: The extension was not removing existing indicators before adding new ones, leading to duplicate elements.

**Fix**: 
- Added code to remove existing scanning indicators before adding new ones in `showScanningIndicator()`
- Added code to remove all existing result indicators before adding new ones in `displayResults()`
- Added code to remove existing error indicators before adding new ones in `showError()`

### 2. Inconsistent Threat Detection
**Problem**: Some files were being marked as both safe and threatening.

**Root Cause**: Duplicate processing of the same attachment and lack of proper deduplication.

**Fix**:
- Enhanced the attachment processing logic to ensure each attachment is only processed once
- Added `clearAllIndicators()` function to remove all existing indicators during rescan
- Improved the attachment ID generation to be more unique

### 3. Need for Reset Button
**Problem**: Users had no way to clear all threat counts and reset statistics.

**Fix**:
- Added a "Reset Stats" button to the popup UI
- Implemented `resetStats()` function in popup.js to clear all statistics
- Added message handler in background.js to handle reset requests
- Added confirmation dialog to prevent accidental resets

### [popup.html](file:///c%3A/Users/TIWAR/Downloads/Cerberus-ai-cybershield-main/Cerberus-ai-cybershield-main/chrome_extension/popup.html)
- Added "Reset Stats" button to the UI

### [popup.js](file:///c%3A/Users/TIWAR/Downloads/Cerberus-ai-cybershield-main/Cerberus-ai-cybershield-main/chrome_extension/popup.js)
- Added event listener for the reset button
- Implemented `resetStats()` function with user confirmation
- Added proper error handling and user feedback

### [background.js](file:///c%3A/Users/TIWAR/Downloads/Cerberus-ai-cybershield-main/Cerberus-ai-cybershield-main/chrome_extension/background.js)
- Added message handler for 'resetStats' type messages
- Implemented statistics reset functionality

### [manifest.json](file:///c%3A/Users/TIWAR/Downloads/Cerberus-ai-cybershield-main/Cerberus-ai-cybershield-main/chrome_extension/manifest.json)
- Added fixes_test.html to web accessible resources

## Testing

### Automated Testing
- Created [fixes_test.html](file:///c%3A/Users/TIWAR/Downloads/Cerberus-ai-cybershield-main/Cerberus-ai-cybershield-main/chrome_extension/fixes_test.html) for verifying the fixes

### Manual Testing
1. Open Gmail with emails containing attachments
2. Verify that each attachment shows only one indicator
3. Click "Rescan Attachments" and verify indicators are properly cleared and re-added
4. Click "Reset Stats" and verify all counters reset to zero
5. Confirm that the reset requires user confirmation

## Verification

After implementing these fixes:
- Attachments should show only one indicator at a time
- Rescanning should properly clear and re-add indicators
- The reset button should clear all statistics with user confirmation
- No duplicate processing of the same attachment should occur

## Future Improvements

- Add more sophisticated deduplication logic for attachments
- Implement persistent tracking of processed attachments across sessions
- Add more granular reset options (e.g., reset only specific counters)
- Enhance the UI with better visual feedback during operations
